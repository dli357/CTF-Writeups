1. Kinda confusing, you were able to brute-force your way to the solution.
2. You need access level < 0x30.
3. If you overflow the name buffer, you write into the access level. By injecting the string:
	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--
	or
	'a' * 15 + '-' * 2
4. This results in access level 0x0000002d, giving you shell. Then:
	cat flag.txt
gives you flag:
