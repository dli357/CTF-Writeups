1. There are three main components to how this 'encryption' algorithm works:
	a. First, the binary pulls the characters, turns them into decimals, and adds them to the value of the character that followed them (E.G. if I gave you character ID's of 5, 10, 15, 20, it would encrypt to 15, 25, 35, 20).
	b. Second, the binary then separates the numbers with commas and turns the entire number-comma system into a string.
	c. Third, the binary then XOR's every single value of the new string with 97.
	d. Finally, the binary then generates a random number and XOR's every single value of the string with that number a random number of times.
2. Since we know that if the number generated is even it will XOR out to itself, we can disregard this part of the encryption scheme.
3. We are really just looking for what builds the first number string: 210,205,200,198,217,227,206,200,168,171,168,139,130,160,206,222,209,211,232,184,182,213,225,239,118,
