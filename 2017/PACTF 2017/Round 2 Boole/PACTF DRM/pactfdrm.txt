1. Seems like the software will not decrypt the file for you.
2. Even looking at the decrypt function yields nothing, as the program only runs on an unlimited loop.
3. Here, I noticed that there was an encrypt function.
4. By reverse-engineering what the function does, you can figure out how the data is encrypted.
5. Turns out that by looking at the decompiled code along with the assembly, encrypting is simply multiplying the decimal representation of every character by 2 and then xor with the decimal 46, or 0x2e.
6. To solve, xor every number with 46 then divide by 2. Find the character representation of every remaining number.
