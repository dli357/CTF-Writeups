First,

credit to https://ehsandev.com/pico2014/cryptography/repeated_xor.html for basically helping me solve the problem. I kinda couldn't get my lazy implementations working.

1. We figure out that this is repeated xor cipher, and, thus, using Kasiski Analysis is the best way to figure out the key length.
2. My tool originally performed kasiski analysis on the key length, but I got stuck at a key length of 6 and convinced myself that was the correct length when, in fact, it was 12.
3. Using his tool helped me decrypt.
