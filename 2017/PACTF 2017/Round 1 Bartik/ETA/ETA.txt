1. Open up the binary in Kali GDB.
2. Once you do that, after running the code and/or setting a few breakpoints, you notice that it hangs at the get_primes function. Why is this?
3. It is because you are trying to get all primes before 2147483644
4. Let's try lowering that number in the register. We know by examining the get_primes function that it is in register RSI. (The decompilation helps too)
5. Lowered it to 3. Once the code ran, it output 3.
6. 2 is a prime number, why didn't it output 2? Thus, had a hunch that the program output the last prime on the list.
7. Look for the largest prime smaller than 2147483644
